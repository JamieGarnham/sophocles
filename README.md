# 'Sophbot' by Jamie Garnham
Program to analyse the likelihood of Ancient Greek conjectures for line 625a of Sophocles' *Oedipus Tyrannus*.
Open the `sophbot` folder and run the code via the notebook `model.ipynb`. Requires a valid Python distribution with `nltk` installed.
Add your own conjectures by adding them to the `conjectures.txt` file. Lemmatise your conjectures manually or via https://outils.biblissima.fr/en/eulexis-web/, then add these lemmas to the `conjlemmas.txt` file.
Raw data files (`sophwords.txt`, `stopwords-el.txt`, and `sophlemmas.txt`) are also provided for inspection.
